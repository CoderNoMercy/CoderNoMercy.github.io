									<h1>This is about<br />
									AI & Music</h1>
									<p>Music is not only the way of listening, but also a way of digital analysis. Why we can distinguish different
									style of music and find one that interests us? Why can we know which one is better and which one is worse? 
									It may be revealed by the pattern of digital signal. AI is a strong tool to learn the distribution. What we do here
									is to use machine learning algorithm to generate new songs that never appear in this world before but still leave 
									people a joyful experience. This job's code link is on the github. Feel free to contact me and talk about what you are interested in~</p>

								<p>GAN is a machine learning algorithm with generator and discriminator. The generator is trained to generate fake 
								picture or digital signal flow to deceive discriminator. The discriminator is trained to dintinguish true or false result. The training process is 
								as following. Generator(with parameter) is given random noise and outputs fake image or other form of signal. The output is given to discriminator(also having parameter)
								to judge whether the input can be regarded as truth. Optimize parameter in generator to deceive discriminator and get a higher score from discriminator's output. So up to now, we trained the 
								generator. But we still need to train discriminator to better judge the output of generator. It is the process just like competition between students and teacher. As student gets a better grade,
								 teacher also becomes more strict. So next we should train the discriminator by input some fake image or other form of signal and the ground truth, and lower the output score(to be more strict) to
								optimize the discriminator.</p>
								<p>In this project, our signal form is music. We choose midi file as our training data to make sure the input and output of our neural network is digital signal. From midi file, we extract notes, pitch
								and chord to compose our training data. First train the discriminator for 1 time and then train generator for 10 times. Repeat this process until the output of discriminator reach Nash Equilibrium, which means
								the discrinimator can no longer distinguish the fake one and true one from the output of generator.</p>
